- provide the input filename as arguments
- try to see how it is possible to read them in with flags before them (eg --filename)
- beware that you need to know how every output files is named
- build the Docker container
- modify the env.yml file so that it contains packages that are actually needed.
- is there test data available to be uploaded on github too (maybe DESeq2 has already something)
