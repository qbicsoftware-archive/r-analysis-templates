# Bioinformatics Pipeline
<!--Different output in presence or absence of DEU analysis-->
Nextflow-based RNA-Seq pipeline release 1.3 https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq [^1] was used for the bioinfomatics analysis. Aggregation of the bioinformatics workflow analysis was conducted by `MultiQC `r as.character(df[df$V1=="MultiQC",2])`` [^2] [@ewels2016multiqc]. `FASTQC `r as.character(df[df$V1=="FASTQC",2])`` [^3] [@andrews2010fastqc] was used to determine quality of the FASTQ files. Subsequently, adapter trimming was conducted with `Trim Galore `r as.character(df[df$V1=="Trim Galore!",2])`` [^4] [@krueger2012trim]. `STAR v`r substring(as.character(df[df$V1=="STAR",2]), 7, )`` [@Dobin2013] aligner was used to map the reads that passed the quality control to the human genome GRCh 38 (Ensembl release 92). The evaluation of the RNA-seq experiment was performed with `RSeQC `r as.character(df[df$V1=="RSeQC",2])`` [@wang2012rseqc] and read counting of the features (e.g. genes) with `featureCounts `r as.character(df[df$V1=="featureCounts",2])``[@liao2014featurecounts].
For differential expression analysis, the raw read count table resulting from `featureCounts` is processed with the R package `DESeq2 v`r packageVersion("DESeq2")`` [@love2014differential].
<!-- If a DEU analysis has also been performed -->
```{r conditional_DEU, echo=FALSE, results='asis', eval=config$DEU}
# version = packageVersion("DEXSeq")
# cat(paste("For differential exon usage, the table count produced by `featureCounts` is processed with the R package `DEXSeq v`",version," [@anders2012detecting].", sep=''))
```
Graphs were also produced in the `RStudio v1.1.456` with `r R.version.string` mainly using the `R` package `ggplot2 v`r packageVersion("ggplot2")``. Reports were produced using the `R` package `rmarkdown v`r packageVersion("rmarkdown")`` while `knitr v`r packageVersion("knitr")`` and `DT v`r packageVersion("DT")`` were running behind the scenes. Sample similarity heatmap was created using `edgeR `r as.character(df[df$V1=="edgeR",2])`` R package.

# Bioinformatics Analysis

## Bioinformatics Analysis Quality Control Summary
Quality control of the data was performed using *FASTQC*. Details on the quality control parameters are available in the `MultiQC` report of all samples available [here](./MultiQC/multiqc_report.html). `FASTQC` reports for individual samples are additionally available [here](`r params$path_fastqc`).
The table below (extracted from the `MultiQC` report) shows a summary of the bioinformatics analysis quality control including the percentage and number of assigned reads (% Assigned, M Assigned), the percentage of aligned reads (% Aligned), trimmed reads (% Trimmed), and duplicate reads (% Dups). The mean GC content (%GC) for each of the sequences and total number of reads (M Seqs) is additionally indicated.

## Mapping Statistics

The alignment scores for each sample are shown below.

### Generalities about mapping rate {.tabset}

The mapping rate of data originating from the sequencing machine depends on several factors:

* The error rate of an Illumina sequencing machine is ~0.1%.
* The error rate for sequencing of GC rich regions is higher.
* Sequencing devices are not able to sequence highly repeated regions.
* Low quality of sequencing data results in a low mapping rate.
* There is no perfect algorithm to align the reads to a reference genome.
* There is no perfect transcript annotation of the reference genome.

## Read Distribution {.tabset}
The read distribution of mapped reads over different genome feature (like CDS exon, 5'UTR exon, 3' UTR exon, Intron, Intergenic regions) is shown below. The majority of the reads is assigned to CDS exons.

```
</center>

## Gene Counts {.tabset}
The gene assignments of featureCounts are shown below. Interpretation of the different assignment types:

**Unassigned_Ambiguity:** The reads could not be assigned because of its ambiguous character. This can be the case when e.g. a read maps to two different genes at the same time making it ambiguos. \
**Unassigned_MultiMapping:** The reads could not be assigned because they map to several distinct locations on the reference genome. \
**Unassigned_NoFeatures:** The reads could not be assigned because their mapping position in the reference genome is not annotated with any gene.

# Statistical Analysis

## Raw and normalized count tables

The raw count table can be found [here](./DESeq2/raw_counts/raw_counts.txt). The normalized count table is available [here](./DESeq2/results/count_tables): rlog_transformed.read.counts.tsv.

## Overview - First Exploration of the Data

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
A PCA plot of the normalized expression values was created to visualize the overall effect of experimental variations and any batch effects among samples.

```{r, echo=F, out.width="2000px", dpi=1200, fig.cap="", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./DESeq2/results/plots/PCA_plot.png")
```

### Sample distance heatmap
A sample distance heatmap was generated from the distances of the normalized expression values for all samples. The closer the distance is to 0, the overall samples gene expression are more similar to each other.

```{r, echo=F, out.width="2000px", dpi=1200, fig.cap="", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./DESeq2/results/plots/Heatmaps_of_distances.png")
```

## Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)

### List of differentially expressed genes

Analysis of the differential gene expression was performed using `DESeq2`. Genes were considered differentially expressed genes (DEG) when the adjusted p-value was lower than 0.05 (padj < 0.05). The adjusted p-value is calculated in the `DESeq2` package with the Benjamini-Hochberg method and helps reduce the number of false postives (not real differentially expressed genes). The model design in DESeq2 was:`r cat(paste(readLines(params$path_design), collapse=" "))`.
The list of all the differentially expressed genes is shown below; The full table, where the differentially expressed genes are marked with DE in the filter1 column, can be found [here](./DESeq2/results/final/final_list_DESeq2.tsv).

```{r}
# library(DT)
# df_DE <- read.table("./DESeq2/results/final/DE_list_DESeq2.tsv", header=TRUE, sep="\t")
# datatable(df_DE, caption = "Table containing DE genes", extensions = c('Buttons', 'FixedColumns'), "Autofill", options = list(dom = 'Bfrtip', scrollX = T, scrollCollapse = T, buttons = c('copy', 'csv', 'excel', 'pdf', 'print')))
```

```{r setup2, echo=FALSE}
library(DT)
# condition: if there is a RIN column in QualityAssessment.csv, prints a statement and the table; if there is no RIN column, or no ./QualityAssessment.csv file, print "RIN values are not available for this project."
contr=FALSE
if(file.exists(params$path_contrasts)){
  df_contr <- read.table(params$path_contrasts, header=TRUE, sep="\t")
  names = grep('vs', colnames(df_contr), value=TRUE)
  if (length(names) != 0){
    contr <- TRUE
  }
}
```

```{r contrasts_block, echo=FALSE, results='asis', eval=contr}
cat("***
Additional tables for all individual contrasts are provided [here](./DESeq2/results//home/silvia/Documents/rnaseq_downstream/r-analysis-templates/report/DESeq2/results/DE_genes_tables):
\
")

for (i in 1:length(names)){
  cat(paste("* ", names[i], "\n"))
}
```

**Please note that the number of differentially expressed genes can be shrinked if one wishes to focus only on the genes with a very meaningful fold change.**

### Plot normalized counts of the genes

Plots of the normalized counts were generated for the all the genes. Count normalization was performed by sequencing depth and adding a pseudocount of 1/2 to allow for log scale plotting. The plots are available at [plot_candidate_genes](./DESeq2/results/plots/plots_requested_genes).
