# RNAseq Report
Silvia Morini  

The directory _report_ should contain:

1) **/references.bibtex** : I suggest that this file is uploaded to the repository, and every time someone adds a reference,this changing is uploaded in the repo - by doing so, we save ourselves time since we are not going to have to go and look for ourselves again.

2) **./logo.png, ./corp-styles.css** : Provides a function "DEXSeqDataSetFromFeatureCounts", to load the output of featureCounts as a dexSeq dataset (dxd) object.

3) **./summary.tsv** : this file is downloadable (https://portal.qbic.uni-tuebingen.de/portal/web/qbic/user-d -> Projects). Until now, it contains information about (see example in parenthesis):
  
    - PI affiliation (WG Ullrich)
    - PI address
    - Contact person
    - Contact affiliation and address (could also be removed: they are the same as PI affiliation and address)
    - PM
    - Manager affiliation (QBiC): could also be removed, the PM will always be from QBiC
    - Manager address (Auf der Morgenstelle â€¦ ): could also be removed, since the address will not often change, it can be written fixed in the template.
